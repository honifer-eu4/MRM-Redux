MRM Redux Patch 4.0.3:

#################### General ########################

Fixed a bug that prevented the events intended to trigger the Reformation in a timely matter from working properly.

################ Country-specific ###################

Burgundy:
    Fixed a bug with the "King of the Franks" mission.

Castile:
    Fixed an oversight allowing Castile/Spain to get 250 Reform Progress for free with the Tercios mission.

France:
    Formation requirements as well as certain missions involving Burgundy now use a was_tag check, blocking unintended ways of completing them.
    "Refine the Bombards" mission now requires mil tech 7 instead of 5, and grants +10% Assault Fort Ability instead of +25%.
