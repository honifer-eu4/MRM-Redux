 emp_swi_develop_the_confederacy_title:0 "Develop the Confederacy"
 emp_swi_develop_the_confederacy_desc:0 "WIP"
 emp_swi_develop_dairies_title:0 "Develop Dairy Farms"
 emp_swi_develop_dairies_desc:0 "The difficulty of growing grain in the alps has forced the highland cantons to rely heavily on dairy products. The excellent cheese and milk in particular has become a burgeoning commodity with the increase in trade routes to the low lying areas of the Swiss Confederacy."
 emp_swi_defend_title:0 "Defend Switzerland"
 emp_swi_defend_desc:0 "William Tell stood up for the people, and bravely fought against the tyrannical Habsburgs. He lit a fire in our people, one that the enemies of our glorious Confederation will never extinguish!"
 emp_swi_annex_east_burgundy_title:0 "Deal with Burgundy"
 emp_swi_annex_east_burgundy_desc:0 "Burgundy has consistently threatened the security of the Confederation and our allies. Charles the Bold's adventures against us and our allies must be dealt with."
 emp_swi_secure_lorraine_title:0 "Secure the West"
 emp_swi_secure_lorraine_desc:0 "Defeating the Burgundian menace has brought us significant wealth, but will undoubtedly enrage France. We must secure Lorraine and as much of Burgundy as possible."

 emp_swi_protect_northern_italy_title:0 "Secure Northern Italy"
 emp_swi_protect_northern_italy_desc:0 "Northern Italy must be secured to defend Lombardy now that it is a part of the Confederation. To allow Northern Italy to fall into French hands would endager all that we have fought and bled for."

We must extend these ideas to all corners of our new lands, and create a Greater Confederation where all can live in harmony."
 emp_swi_elite_infantry_title:0 "Swiss Elite Infantry"
 emp_swi_elite_infantry_desc:0 "Our infantry units have earned a reputation as some of the best in Europe, fighting tirelessly to defend our Confederation from any foreign invaders that threaten it. While some in our court advise us to shift our focus to the new innovations of artillery, most believe it would be wiser to focus on what appears to be our specialty."
 emp_swi_army_reforms_title:0 "Military Modernization"
 emp_swi_army_reforms_desc:0 "While our focus on infantry has allowed us to succeed up to this point, it is clear that the weaknesses in our military can no longer be ignored. We must approach this manner with caution, making sure to upgrade our cannons to modern standards while continuing to ensure the success of our infantry."

 #Events

 redux_swi.1.t:0 "The Question of Geneva"
 redux_swi.1.d:0 "Geneva would make a great addition to our Confederation, but we must decide how to proceed. Our diplomats suggest sending their leaders a carefully crafted proposal, promising them a generous amount of autonomy and protection in exchange for their submission. This autonomy could perhaps be revoked at a later time, but it would certainly be a lengthy process. Alternatively, our spies have reported that our cause has a large amount of support among the Genevese ranks. Our generals suggest that a military intervention would face little resistance."

 redux_swi.5.t:0 "Defeat"
