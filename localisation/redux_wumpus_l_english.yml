 flavor_kk.1.t: "Emerging Identities In Bosnia"
 flavor_kk.1.d: "Centuries of religious conflict between the various churches of Bosnia have left the nation without direction. With the collapse of the Bosnian state and Bosnia's integration into our Empire, there is a growing acceptance of Islam. Through promoting conversion and sponsoring Islam in the region, we can bring prosperity and control to the unstable region."
 flavor_kk.BOSNIA1: "Let us support our new Muslim brothers."

 flavor_kk.2.t: "Mass Conversions in Albania"
 flavor_kk.2.d: "Our conquest of the lands of Skanderbeg has yielded considerable fruits in the area. Through promises of political influence and an escape from the Dhimmi restrictions, overwhleming numbers of Albanians have converted to Islam. These converts seem eager to serve in government positions, as well as flocking to the standards to join our great armies!"
 flavor_kk.ALBANIA1: "The Albanians are proving themselves useful and loyal subjects to the Sultan."

 flavor_kk.3.t: "Migrations in Kosovo"
 flavor_kk.3.d: "The subjugation of Kosovo and its riches is showing itself to be an incredible boon to the state. With the newfound prosperity and opportunities of the recently converted Albanians, many Muslims who reside in the borderlands between Albania and Kosovo have begun to migrate throughout this new land in high numbers. The Islamization of Kosovo is complete."
 flavor_kk.KOSOVO1: "The Albanians have done our Empire a great service."

 flavor_kk.4.t: "Turkish Settlements in Bulgaria"
 flavor_kk.4.d: "Though we have controlled Bulgaria for an extended period of time, settlement of Anatolian Muslims in Bulgaria has been typically limited to its border areas with Thrace. However, under the new provisions of our glorious Sultan, sizeable numbers of Bulgarians have converted to Islam, and settlement by Anatolian Turks has been promoted throughout the region. While these Muslims are spread around Bulgaria, large numbers have emerged in the Northern reaches of the country in and around Tirnovo, breathing new life into the capital of the old Bulgarian state."
 flavor_kk.TIRNOVO1: "These colonists will assist us in projecting our might throughout the Balkans."
 flavor_kk.TIRNOVO2: "We should redirect these settlers towards Constantinople."

 flavor_kk.5.t: "The Great Greek Uprising"
 flavor_kk.5.d: "Citing supposedly arbitrary actions on the part of our government officials, and emboldened by support from our rivals abroad, nobles and commoners alike have taken up arms against us in Epirus and Achaea. Sentiments against our state have become so pronounced, that across Greece, many Dhimmi are refusing to pay the Jizya, and even worse, are not abiding by their duty to supply our armies with soldiers. The situation has quickly spiralled into rebellion, the kind which we will not soon see the end of."
 flavor_kk.GREECE1: "It is time to put an end to Greek dissent."

 flavor_kk.6.t: "An End to Hostilities in Greece"
 flavor_kk.6.d: "After putting down the initial uprisings and a long period of discontent by the people of Greece, we are in a position to take decisive action to end this revolt once and for all."
 flavor_kk.GREECE2: "This revolt has cost us enough already. Let us negotiate with their leaders."
 flavor_kk.GREECE3: "We must purge them! Massacre the perpetrators and anyone involved!"

 flavor_kk.7.t: "Staple City of the East"
 flavor_kk.7.d: "Lwow, the principal city of our Ruthenian domains, is of great strategic importance and financial potential, being placed on a major trade route between our heartlands and the Black Sea. However, the city is stagnant and in desperate need of renovation. By designating Lwow as a staple city, we can revive its importance and bring prosperity to the area, as well as promoting Polish culture among its inhabitants and bringing new migrants from our heartlands to bolster the growing city's population."
 flavor_kk.LWOW1: "Lwow waits to be awaken from its slumber."
 
 flavor_kk.8.t: "The Riches of Lwow"
 flavor_kk.8.d: "Lwow's status as a staple city has brought a steady flow of wealth and immigrants into the town, restoring its significance as one of the greatest cities in our realm. The High Castle of Lwow has also been reoutfitted to serve as a stalwart fortress to protect our subjects. The city's new wealth, greater defenses, and spread of Polish culture mark the beginning of a golden age in the history of Galicia."
 flavor_kk.LWOW2: "Lwow truly is the jewel of Ruthenia!"

 flavor_kk.9.t: "Adoption of a Single Currency"
 flavor_kk.9.d: "One of the stipulations of the Treaty of Lublin, recently signed to unite the nation, was to adopt a mutual currency in both our Polish and Lithuanian territories. The Zloty, and its expansion as the single, standardized currency, will allow us to more effeciently levy taxes on exchanged goods, granting a boon of income to the crown."
 flavor_kk.COMMONWEALTHCURRENCY: "The economic stability of the Commonwealth is vital!"

 flavor_kk.10.t: "Polonization of Vilnius"
 flavor_kk.10.d: "With the union of the Commonwealth now under full effect, the dominance of Polish culture within the old capital of Vilnius and its surrounding areas is becoming rapidly apparent. Due to a combination of increased social mobility for Lithuanians who learn the Polish language, and significant migration from the Polish heartland to this eastern city, Polish culture can be seen in everything from the architecture, to the music, to the language of the people. There are several routes we can take to transform the now revived city of Vilnius into a proper Polish city."
 flavor_kk.POLESLITHUANIA1: "We should promote Vilnius as a population center to serve the Empire economically."
 flavor_kk.POLESLITHUANIA2: "The colleges of Vilnius and their intellectual contributions is more important."

 flavor_kk.11.t: "English Settlers in Normandy"
 flavor_kk.11.d: "Through the sponsorship of overseas settlements by English people, we have established a prosperous and stable community loyal to England in Normandy. Born of a culture of war and hostility against the French, these settlers are flocking to the standards, and are willing to fight and lay down their lives to protect their new lands and the Empire."
 flavor_kk.ENGLISHNORMANS1: "Normandy will strengthen the Empire as it did centuries ago."
 
 flavor_kk.12.t: "El Gran Capitan"
 flavor_kk.12.d: "As our war rages against the French, a rising star rides forward from the lands of Cordoba. He is poised to bring us great victories, and is proposing amazing innovations to reform our military, introducing new tactics with defensive and offensive regiments, organizing our regiments in such a way that we shall outmaneuver any enemy, and route any foe on the battlefield. He is El Gran Capitan!"
 flavor_kk.GRANCAPITAN: "The Great Captain will lead us to victory!"
 
 flavor_kk.13.t: "Explusion of the Jewry"
 flavor_kk.13.d: "There is much discontent with the state of the Jewry in Spain. Rumors of Judaizing Christians and accusations of unfair usury against the Catholic population have caused great upheaval and discontent within our realm. The crown has settled that it is for the best to expell the Jewish communities from Spain. This will provide the crown with a wealth of seized assets, as well as bringing stability to Spain."
 flavor_kk.SPAINEXILEDJEWS1: "They have left us no choice."
 
 flavor_kk.14.t: "The Nature of the Republic"
 flavor_kk.14.d: "Having brought all of Italy under our control, the question of the nature of the new Italian Republic is on everyone's minds. We could organize the Republic on a Federal basis, from the capital, ruling over all our lands directly, enabling the head of state to take further power. Alternatively, we could organize a Federation on a regional basis, which would aid us in administrating the provinces, but could lead to alienation from the capital among our subjects if we do not maintain a watchful eye."
 flavor_kk.ITALIANFEDERATION1: "We shall have a Federal Republic."
 flavor_kk.ITALIANFEDERATION2: "We shall have a Federation."
 
 flavor_kk.15.t: "The Sejm Undermines our Authority"
 flavor_kk.15.d: "The gathering of the Sejm, an assembly of land nobility, was once simply a convention brought together at the King's behest. This parliament has evolved, however, into a power structure of its own, often challenging the crown's authority, and other times legitimizing it. In our recent efforts to reform the administration of our state, the Sejm has undermined our ability to meet these challenges out of a desire to secure their own power and influence. We must choose either to push through by any means necessary, or to allow them to hinder our efforts once again."
 flavor_kk.SEJM1: "The Sejm must learn its place."
 flavor_kk.SEJM2: "Perhaps caution is of value here."
 
 flavor_kk.16.t: "Tensions with the Jews"
 flavor_kk.16.d: "As a society with entrenched religious ideals, there is a rising tension between the true believers of our faith and the Jewish minority that dwells in our lands. Accusations of immorality and usury against the commoners has brought this tension to a boiling point, and there are many within our realm calling for an expulsion of the Jewry."
 flavor_kk.RELIGIOUSJEWISHEXPULSION1: "We will not expel the Jews from our lands."
 flavor_kk.RELIGIOUSJEWISHEXPULSION2: "Issue an edict of expulsion against the Jews immediately."
  
 flavor_kk.17.t: "Naples, the City of Pizza"
 flavor_kk.17.d: "As trade flows into the Mediterranean from the New World, various crops have been brought to markets in our cities. Among these is the tomato, a vegetable which the people of Naples have taken a particular liking to, complimenting their bread with it. This new dish, called the Pizza, is popular among the peasants, and provides for them an additional staple food, increasing the demand for grain and easing the standard of living among the people of the city."
 flavor_kk.NAPLESPIZZA: "Oh boy oh boy, who doesn't love a good pizza pie?"
 
 flavor_kk.18.t: "Crown of Ireland Act"
 flavor_kk.18.d: "Since the sanction of our conquest of Ireland by the pope in the 12th century, Ireland has been administered by our Kings as the Lords of Ireland, while the annual tribute taken from the nobility and commoners of Ireland was given directly to the Papacy. Now, with the English Reformation in full swing, the power-sharing structure of Ireland between the English monarchy and the papacy is a fully outdated system. With our secession from the Catholic church, it has become apparent than Ireland must be reorganized into a Kingdom, with its crown held by the King of England. There are two approaches at our disposal as of now. On the one hand, we could choose to tolerate the Hibernian natives, granting them a certain degree of autonomy, and conscripting them to fill the ranks of our armies. This strategy would surely provide for us a more loyal Irish populace as subjects. On the other hand, there are those who yearn for the Anglo-Saxon settlement of the island. While such a venture would undoubtedly cause strife with the natives, and would be a significantly costly undertaking, Anglicizing the island could yield benefits in ensuring a loyal and integrated Ireland."
 flavor_kk.ENGLANDCROWNOFIRELAND1: "Hibernia will be protected under our rule as their Kings."
 flavor_kk.ENGLANDCROWNOFIRELAND2: "Hibernia must be tamed by way of direct Anglo-Saxon colonization."

 flavor_kk.19.t: "The Settlement of Ireland"
 flavor_kk.19.d: "With the Act of Unity securing our colonial rights to the Irish island, there is a need to supplement efforts towards settlement of the island. Dublin, the natural base for such a settlement, would serve as the launching grounds for English settlers to civilize the island, bringing with them our Anglo-Saxon culture. We could hold off on committing to such an endeavor, but sooner or later, we must involve ourselves directly."
 flavor_kk.ENGLANDSETTLEMENTOFIRELAND1: "Now is not yet the time for full settlement."
 flavor_kk.ENGLANDSETTLEMENTOFIRELAND2: "Ready the colonists, it is time to civilize the Pale of Ireland."

 flavor_kk.20.t: "Eastern Ireland Settled"
 flavor_kk.20.d: "Through decades of settlement, our English culture has reached from the northern reaches of the Irish sea, down to the highlands of the Irish south. English settlers dominate the island, and we have secured a loyal populace among the more developed, eastern half of the island."
 flavor_kk.ENGLANDSETTLEDEASTIRELAND: "Eastern Ireland now stands as a proud extension of England."

 flavor_kk.21.t: "The Fate of Western Ireland"
 flavor_kk.21.d: "While the more civilized and developed eastern half of Ireland has become fully Anglicized thanks to our colonial efforts, the more primitive west of the island remains utterly Gaelic. While we could press on with our colonial policy in aims to unite all of Ireland under Anglo-Saxon settlement, such an effort would remain costly, with diminishing returns. Alternatively, we could provide the western reaches with an autonomous designation, allowing them to retain certain principles of self-governance and simply conscripting the Celts into the ranks of our armies, ruling the island from the more significant east."
 flavor_kk.ENGLANDSETTLEMENTWESTIRELAND1: "Western Ireland is an unimportant backwater, our colonial efforts are complete."
 flavor_kk.ENGLANDSETTLEMENTWESTIRELAND2: "The whole of Ireland must be thoroughly Anglicized!"

 flavor_kk.22.t: "The Whole of Ireland Anglicized"
 flavor_kk.22.d: "Through decades of laborious settlement, colonization, and near-constant repression of Gaelic uprisings, the whole of Ireland now stands thoroughly Anglicized. While there are of course pockets of stubborn Gaels, resisting the new Anglo-Saxon nature of the island, the dominant culture from east to west in Hiberia is that of the Englishman."
 flavor_kk.ENGLANDSETTLEDWESTIRELAND: "At long last, Hibernia is our western jewel."

 flavor_morwumpus.EVTNAME1:0 "Last Hurrah of Trans-Saharan Trade"
 flavor_morwumpus.EVTDESC1:0 "For centuries, the Berbers have carried trade across the inhospitable Sahara Desert to our cities. This arrangement has been greatly beneficial to us, as we sit on the crossroads between the West African gold mines and slave hubs, and the Mediterranean markets. While the Trans-Saharan trade is in decline due to European intervention in African markets directly, we will still benefit from the current trade environment for decades to come."

This outflow of the heathens has generated much wealth for the coffers of the city, rightfully ours for the taking, and spurred tremendous growth within its walls. Not only that, but the Borj Nord, the great citadel overlooking Fez, is in as powerful a state as ever, ready to repel any invaders or challengers to our rule at a moments notice."
