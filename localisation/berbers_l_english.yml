 gc_tun_ibadi_desc:0 "The Ibadi denomination of the Muslim faith is claimed to hold even greater legitimacy and age than the Sunni and Shia ones. While some are not convinced, our ruler has answered the call and is determined to lead an Ibadi state. However, is it possible that he is mistaken?"
 gc_tun_desert_development_title:0 "Settle the Desert"

 gc_tun_conversion_of_sicily_title:0 "Conversion of Sicily"
 gc_tun_conversion_of_sicily_desc:0 "In a not so distant past, much of the population of Sicily practiced Islam.

With the gradual integration of Sicilians into our administration and numerous other rewards and benefits this should be acheived in no time."
 gc_tun_sack_of_rome_title:0 "The 9th Sack of Rome"
 gc_tun_sack_of_rome_desc:0 "We have struck at the heart of Christendom, with the sack of Rome itself we have surely struck fear into the hearts of every Christian in Italy and perhaps across all of Europe.

 gc_mor_salt_trade_desc:0 "One of the most lucrative aspects of the Saharan trade routes besides gold and ivory is salt. A good necessary for people of all walks of life to keep their food from spoiling for more than a few days, control over this trade will bring us great riches."
 gc_mor_algerian_ports_title:0 "Algerian Ports"
 gc_mor_algerian_ports_desc:0 "We should focus our efforts on developing our new Algerian possessions into greater centers of trade. Expanding the port facilities on the Barbary Coast has the added effect of giving the Barbary Pirates a larger, more sophisticated base of operations.

 adu_moorish_shock_cavalry_title:0 "Moorish Shock Cavalry"
 adu_moorish_shock_cavalry_desc:0 "While most in Europe have long abandoned mailed knights and frontal cavalry charges in favor of pike and shot warfare, we have managed to still find a use for our heavy cavalry. By integrating our cavalry into pike and shot tactics we can utilize them for morale shocks to our enemies in-between the volleys of our musketeers. With the expansion of military infrastructure and higher training standards across Iberia we can field more of these Moorish shock cavalry regiments."
 adu_adopt_european_ships_title:0 "Adopt European Ships"

Perhaps we should look to producing goods that will stand a better chance of generating profit in the future. Many have been suggesting to focus on cultivation of the cotton plant in Lower Andalusia, while others wish to establish new manufactories for the production of paper, cloth, or even silk that would rival the famed Persian and Chinese works.

 flavor_mor.15.b:0 "Let the Christians keep their culture"
