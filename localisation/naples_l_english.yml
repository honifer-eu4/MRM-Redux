 emp_nap_conquer_central_italy_title:0 "Invade Central Italy"

 emp_nap_consolidate_our_holdings_title:0 "Consolidate Our Holdings"
 emp_nap_consolidate_our_holdings_desc:0 "It is no doubt a glorious day for our country as Sicily is now back under our control, hopefully for good. However, we must not get too caught up in our celebrations - enemies are surely waiting for an opportunity to strike. We must consolidate our holdings and get ready to fight for our survival."
 emp_nap_kingdom_of_africa_title:0 "Kingdom of Africa"
 emp_nap_kingdom_of_africa_desc:0 "Our forebears, the Normans, conquered and created the Kingdom of Africa out of the old province of Africa.

 emp_nap_conquer_the_baleares_title:0 "Conquer the Balearic Islands"
 emp_nap_conquer_the_baleares_desc:0 "Our country was once under the rule of the King of Aragon, and it seems there are some who will never forget it. We must seize the Balearic Islands lest the Aragonese or Spanish use it as a base to attack us."
 emp_nap_restore_albania_title:0 "Restore Albania" 
 emp_nap_restore_albania_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Albania was a bastion of Catholicism in a sea of heretics and heathens. It failed on numerous occasions to defend itself against its threats, so it stands to reason that we should intervene in the region to help our brothers in faith."
 emp_nap_calabrian_silk_title:0 "Develop Calabrian Silk"
 emp_nap_calabrian_silk_desc:0 "Ever since the Dark Ages, Calabria and Catanzaro have been a great source of wealth due to the enormous potential of their silk industry. We must continue to invest in these provinces so they can bring prosperity and riches to our nation."

 emp_nap_conquer_maghreb_title:0 "Conquer the Maghreb"
 emp_nap_conquer_maghreb_desc:0 "The old Kingdom of Africa conquered all of Tunis, but we will go one step further. Our holdings cannot be secure until we have taken over all of the Maghreb."
 emp_nap_defense_title:0 "Fortify Molise"
 emp_nap_defense_desc:0 "Our ambition to unify all of Italy is well-known, meaning a confrontation with other Italian powers is likely. We should begin investing extra funds into building fortifications in Molise, protecting us from any who wish to siege our great city."

 nap_two_sicilies_reunited:0 "Two Sicilies Reunited"
 desc_nap_two_sicilies_reunited:0 "Long ago, there was only one Kingdom of Sicily that controlled nearly all of Southern Italy.

But now, we have managed to reunite the two halves of the broken state."
 calabrian_silk:0 "Calabrian Silk"
 desc_calabrian_silk:0 "At the peak of silk production, Calabria and Catanzaro accounted for over 50% of European silk. Tens of thousands of workers are supported by the silk production in Catanzaro. Silk production and processing is a closely kept secret lest these arcane secrets spread further into Europe and cripple the economy of Calabria."
 kof_conquered_maghreb_modifier:0 "Conquered the Maghreb"
 desc_kof_conquered_maghreb_modifier:0 "Against all odds, we have managed to unite all of the Maghreb under our rule."

 kof_repopulate_africa_desc:0 "The old Roman province of Africa was once the breadbasket of the empire.

 kof_velvet_glove:0 "Rule with a Velvet Glove"
 kof_velvet_glove_desc:0 "We, like the Kingdom of Africa that predates us, have shown tolerance to the Mohammedan. But make no mistake, our tolerance is not out of misplaced benevolence. We will convert these Arabized heathens to believe in Jesus Christ, but we must do so slowly and methodically."
