 # Church Aspects
 desc_organised_through_bishops_aspect:1 "Bishops used to be leader of a single church, confined to an urban area. Nowadays, they lead the churches of a larger area and no longer serve individual congregations. Priests are appointed to minister each congregation, and acts as the bishop's delegate."
 desc_priests_may_marry_aspect:1 "Emperor Justinian I declared all marriages contracted by clerics in Holy Orders null and void and children of such marriages illegitimate. Priests have always, more or less illegally, lived with their wives and raised families although celibacy is expected of them. By allowing priests to marry we set the seal of approval on clerical marriage and condemn vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds."
 desc_adult_baptism_aspect:1 "Being baptized as an adult on the basis of profession of faith in Jesus Christ and as admission into a local community of faith is made by those who believe that saving grace and church membership are gifts from God. The recipient's faith must be vocalized and cannot be imparted or transferred from one person to another."
 desc_holy_sacraments_aspect:1 "The seven sacraments are rituals that are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. These Holy Sacraments are: Baptism, Confirmation or Chrismation, Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony."
 desc_saints_accept_prayers_aspect:1 "The Intercession of saints, that saints may be asked to intercede or pray for others, is a doctrine supported by our church."
 desc_icons_images_aspect:1 "The images depicting Jesus, Mary, saints and angels, cast in metal, carved in stone, embroidered on cloth, painted on wood or made in many different ways are often illuminated. These icons have been debated and opposed, but the popular favor for icons have guaranteed their continued existence and the Church have finally resigned themselves to allow the veneration of icons."
 desc_legalised_divorces_aspect:1 "The Church authority determined the annulment of marriages until it came to be considered a civil contract. Civil authorities can decree a 'divortium a vinculo matrimonii' or 'divorce from all the bonds of marriage', thus dissolving a marriage."
 desc_heretics_deported_aspect:1 "The executions of heretics who opposes our Church in beliefs or opinions deemed heretical is being replaced with the deportation of those guilty of this sin."
 desc_parish_registers_aspect:1 "Details of baptisms, marriages and burials will from now on be documented in a parish register. Each parish priest will keep a book where they will enter these events and keep it in a sure coffer with two locks."
 desc_individual_creeds_aspect:1 "Accepting and having a higher tolerance of freethinking which allows people to form their own opinions and beliefs about religion leads to a boost in technology."
 desc_allow_usury_aspect:1 "Monetary loans with interest that enrich the lender is now allowed and no longer considered sinful."
 desc_translated_bibles_aspect:1 "Translating bibles to other languages gives people the best resource for knowing God in a language that speaks to their minds and hearts."
 desc_justified_religious_war_aspect:1 "The new Church of the country is threatened by heathens and heretics alike. In a war of self-preservation, the Church will justify our conflicts with the Bible."
 desc_war_preaches_aspect:1 "In times of conflicts the faith preserves the hope of our people. The Church of our realm will preach from the holy book to keep the morale of the population even during the darkest hours up."
 desc_head_of_the_church_aspect:1 "The Church is no longer subject to one external, corrupt theocrat. Instead, all religious issues shall be now redirected to the ruler who serves as the new Head of the Faith."
