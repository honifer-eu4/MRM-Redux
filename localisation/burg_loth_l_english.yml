 #Events
 incidents_bur_inheritance.7.t:0 "Imperial Entrance"
 incidents_bur_inheritance.7.d:0 "Our state originally owed its existence to the royal family of Burgundy who broke away from the French Kingdom in an attempt to press our rightful claim on the Throne of all Franks. We have thus far not opted to press our claim on the Kingdom of France and as such, our claim has long since grown cold. The notion of a truly independent Burgundy existing in perpetuity is laughable to many foreign nobles, and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been advised by the royal council to seek entrance into the Holy Roman Empire and bend the knee to [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] [Emperor.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] as an Imperial Prince.\n\nThe opportunities for Burgundy in the Empire are great, and perhaps one day we may even claim the Emperorship for ourselves..."
