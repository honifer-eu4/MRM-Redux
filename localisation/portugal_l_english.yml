 # Events
 flavor_por.EVTNAME12:0 "Garcia de Resende"
 flavor_por.EVTDESC12:0 "Garcia de Resende was a Portugese poet who had great favor in the courts of several of Portugal's kings. Throughout his life he traveled through much of Southern Europe and served the monarchs of Portugal in many different capacities. For his efforts he was knighted under the Order of Christ, elevated to a nobleman, and given many pensions. His Cancioneiro Geral (general songbook) is widely recognized to be the transition point of old Portuguese to the Portuguese language of today."
 flavor_por.EVTOPTA12:0 "Ok"
 flavor_por.EVTNAME13:0 "Sebastian de Avis"
 flavor_por.EVTDESC13:0 "Sebastian de Avis was, to some, the greatest king of Portugal and the Avis dynasty. He ascended the throne at the age of 3, and would rule for the remainder of his short life. A scholar, wise military leader, and devout catholic he wouuld bring much needed reform and hope back to the people of Portugal. His otherwise highly successful tenure as monarch would be cut short in a noble, but admittedly rather unnecessary and foolhardy, crusade against Morocco where he and indeed a great number of the nobles of Portugal would be cut down by a Moroccan army 3 times their number. After his death, many of the Portuguese people continued to believe that he was alive and hoped for his safe return to Portugal. This never materialized, however, and this would mark the end of the Avis dynasty a few short years later. Though pretenders claiming to be Sebastian would continue to plague the Spanish crown with uprisings for the remainder of the Iberian Union."
 flavor_por.EVTOPTA13:0 "He will make a fine king"
 flavor_por.EVTOPTB13:0 "Keep him as an advisor"

Soon, all of the ancient province will be under our control. Iberia's strength and dominance no longer to be trifled with nor trampled upon."

This is the second death.\n15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."

It empowered judges, appointed by the king, to administer justice throughout the realm. Their rights being infringed upon and privileges and land curtailed, many of the nobility opted for a path of resistance. This would not last, however, as their leader, the Duke of Braganza, would be executed for treason. The king would then go on to murder his brother-in-law and around 80 more rebellious members of the aristocracy, putting the conspiracy against the crown to sleep for good."
