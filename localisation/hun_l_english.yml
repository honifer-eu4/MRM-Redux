 redux_hun.1.t:0 "The Religious Question"
 redux_hun.1.d:0 "Hungary has traditionally been a Catholic kingdom, but as we continue our conquests of the Balkans, we find we have an increasingly large number of Orthodox subjects living under our rule. Some advisors in our court have suggested changing our state religion to appease our new peoples, adding that in time, we could even claim the mantle of the fallen empire of Byzantium. Others disagree, and paint a maintained devotion to Catholicism as the only path forward."

 redux_hun.1.optb:0 "Convert to Orthodoxy, and make it clear that all those who do not follow will perish."
